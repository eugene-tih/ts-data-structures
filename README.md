# TypeScript Data Structures

This repository contains TypeScript based examples of many
popular data structures. The majority of data structures based on .NET data structure interfaces.

Each structure is fully independent from another ones, has its own short README with some information.
Build was tested on Mac, but probably will work on Linux and Windows.
