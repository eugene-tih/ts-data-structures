#Binary Tree

AVL tree is widely known as _self-balancing binary search tree_.
It is named after its creator (Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Landisâ€™ tree).
In AVL Tree, the heights of child subtrees at any node differ by at most 1.
At anytime if height difference becomes greater than 1 then tree balancing is done to restore its property.

## Complexity

| Access | Search | Insertion | Deletion |
| ------ | ------ | --------- | -------- |
| O(n)   | O(n)   | O(n)      | O(n)     |

## Example

```javascript
const myLinkedList = new LinkedList();
myLinkedList.addFirst('Hello');
myLinkedList.addLast('World');

myLinkedList.contains('Bark!');
myLinkedList.clear();
```
