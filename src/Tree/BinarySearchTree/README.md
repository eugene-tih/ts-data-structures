#Binary Search Tree

Binary Search Trees or BST for short are a particular application of binary trees.
BST has at most two nodes (like all binary trees). However, the values are in such a way
that the left children value must be less than the parent, and the right children is
must be higher.

**Duplicates**: Some BST doesnâ€™t allow duplicates while others add the same values as a
right child. Other implementations might keep a count on a case of the duplicity. Current realization
does not allow duplicates.

## Complexity

| Access | Search | Insertion | Deletion |
| ------ | ------ | --------- | -------- |
| O(n)   | O(n)   | O(n)      | O(n)     |

## Example

```javascript
const myLinkedList = new LinkedList();
myLinkedList.addFirst("Hello");
myLinkedList.addLast("World");

myLinkedList.contains("Bark!");
myLinkedList.clear();
```
